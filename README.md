# deltqz's mpv scripts

### sub-blocklist.lua
Blacklist subtitles by matching words in their title (case-insensitive, partial match).
By default, the words `sign(s), song(s), dub(s)` are blacklisted, so mpv should ignore any subtitles meant to accompain dubs. Useful for based sub watchers who have alang=jpn set by default but want to autoselect the full subs.
